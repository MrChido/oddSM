<h2>The purpose of this project.</h2>
<p>There is no dedicated Player Stat manager on the Apple App store.
<br>This is the reason why I am creating this web app.
<br>During normal game play there are cards that get tucked under the players character card, this can be a hassle to do, and some may hide or get hidden.
<br>This web app is to consolidate that information that the player has acquired into a mobile minded app.
<br>This could also allow the cards, that would have been kept by the player, to remain in circulation.</p>
